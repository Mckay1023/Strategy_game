This is a Strategy Game in progress using Epic Games Unreal Engine. Contained in this folder is some of the starter content that the Engine provides for you, most of which
are not used at all. In the content folder under Strategy Game you will find Blueprints that were created by me for use in the game. Anything created in C++ must be turned
into a blueprint for it to interact with other blueprints in the game so I chose this method instead of the C++ method. The blueprints may not be visible and I do not know
how to make them visible unless you download the UnrealEngine and load the project.
